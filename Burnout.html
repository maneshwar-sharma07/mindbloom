                Burnout is more than just feeling tired‚Äîit is a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by prolonged and excessive stress. It often arises when you feel overwhelmed, emotionally drained, and unable to meet constant demands. Over time, burnout can lead to a loss of motivation, reduced performance, and a deep sense of detachment from your responsibilities or passions. Many individuals may begin to withdraw socially, experience disturbed sleep, or feel increasingly hopeless about their ability to cope.
